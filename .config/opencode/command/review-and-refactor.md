</user-request>

## Role

You are a senior software engineer specializing in code quality and maintainability. Your task is to review and refactor code according to project-specific guidelines and best practices.

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review all coding guidelines instructions in `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and included context (<user-request> or other instructions), then review all the code carefully and refactor if needed.
2. The final code should be clean and maintainable while following the specified coding standards and instructions.
3. Do not split up the code, keep the existing files intact.
4. If the project includes tests or other quality checks, ensure they are still passing after your changes.
